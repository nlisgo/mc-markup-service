            <p>eLife posts the editorial decision letter and author response on a selection of the published articles (subject to the approval of the authors). An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <a href="http://www.elifesciences.org/the-journal/review-process">review process</a>). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p>

        <p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Rapid Localized Spread and Immunologic Containment Define Herpes Simplex Virus-2 Reactivation in the Human Genital Tract” for consideration at <em>eLife</em>. Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The editors and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the editors have assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) The paper lacks a proper sensitivity analysis that correlates parameter variability to outcomes of interest. This really needs to be performed to make the results complete. While the parametrization is robust and identifiability does not seem to be a major issue in this case, a sensitivity analysis could give additional insight in the dynamics of infection.</p><p>In the manuscript, two very concise statements are given on the topic from which one understands that sensitivity analysis is only used to identify the range of parameter values by progressively modifying one at a time the values of parameters and keeping all other fixed (to which value?) until the fitting score exceeds a quality threshold. However, a multi-dimensional parameter space exploration is more suited to understand the relationships between input and model's output and can allow the identification of critical dynamics of the system (see, for example, Marino et al., JTB, 2008).</p><p>2) What does the model suggest are likely drivers of variability between patients?</p><p>3) How sensitive is the model to seeding frequency or location?</p><p>4) What is the impact of the starting distribution of immune cells on the dynamics or success of lesions?</p><p>5) What is the main driver of the size of the lesions?</p><p>6) Please discuss the likely implications of the work for transmission and how it is related to the presence or absence of lesions.</p>
