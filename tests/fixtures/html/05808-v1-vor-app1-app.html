<h2>Appendix 1</h2><div class="boxed-text"><div class="section appendix" id="s7"><h4>Technical Background: signal amplitude and SNR depend on K<sub>D</sub></h4><p>The expected dF/F<sub>0</sub> signal amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a transient analyte-dependent fluorescence increase is a major factor in determining the suitability of an indicator dye for a given measurement. In Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, the interplay between fluorescence gain (F<sub>max</sub> = F<sub>peak</sub>/F<sub>resting</sub>), indicator brightness, and indicator K<sub>D</sub> will determine the signal amplitude and SNR for a given [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient amplitude. Assuming that dyes based on the same fluorophore have similar brightness, the K<sub>D</sub> and the fluorescence gain will determine the suitability of indicators for detecting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients of a given size. Other factors, such as the need to remain in a linear regime of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-to-fluorescence relation or the need to avoid excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering, will also play a role in choosing the best suited indicator. As these factors have been discussed in detail previously (<a class="xref-bibr" href="#bib29a">Yasuda et al., 2004</a>; <a class="xref-bibr" href="#bib31">Higley and Sabatini, 2008</a>), we here focus only on signal amplitude and SNR.</p><p>Depending on the size of a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient, different affinity indicators will give the best possible signal and SNR. Here we compare the recently published CaRuby-Me (K<sub>D</sub> = 3.4 µM; gain = 62.5) and the novel indicator described in this publication, CaRuby-Nano, (K<sub>D</sub> = 258 nM; gain = 50; see main text for details).</p><p>The basis for our calculations is following equation describing the relationship between [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and fluorescence intensity:<span class="disp-formula" id="equ1"><span class="mathjax mml-math"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><msup><mrow><mtext>Ca</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2b;</mo></mrow></msup><mo>]</mo></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></msub><mo>&#x3d;</mo><mfrac><mrow><mrow><mo>[</mo><msup><mrow><mtext>Ca</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&#x2b;</mo></mrow></msup><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>D</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac><mo>&#x2217;</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow><mi>max</mi></mrow></msub><mo>&#x2b;</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow><mi>max</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math></span></span></p><p>The resulting fluorescence vs [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] curves for both CaRuby-Me and CaRuby-Nano are shown in <a class="xref-fig" href="#fig6">Appendix figure 1A</a>.</p><div class="fig" data-doi="10.7554/eLife.05808.015"><div id="fig6" class="fig-inline-img-set"><div class="elife-fig-image-caption-wrapper"><div class="fig-expansion"><div class="fig-inline-img"><a href="[graphic-elife-05808-app1-fig1-v1-large]" class="figure-expand-popup" title="Appendix 1 Figure 1."><img data-img="[graphic-elife-05808-app1-fig1-v1-small]" src="[graphic-elife-05808-app1-fig1-v1-medium]" alt="Appendix 1 Figure 1."/></a></div><div class="fig-caption"><span class="elife-figure-links"><span class="elife-figure-link elife-figure-link-download"><a href="[graphic-elife-05808-app1-fig1-v1-large]" download>Download figure</a></span><span class="elife-figure-link elife-figure-link-newtab"><a href="[graphic-elife-05808-app1-fig1-v1-large]" target="_blank">Open in new tab</a></span></span><span class="fig-label">Appendix 1 Figure 1.</span> <span class="caption-title">Signal amplitude and SNR depend on indicator K<sub>D</sub>.</span><p class="first-child">(<strong>A</strong>) [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-dependent fluorescence for CaRuby-Me (blue) and CaRuby-Nano (red).

Assuming a resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] of 50 nM, the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>peak</sub> dependence of dF/F<sub>0</sub> for CaRuby-Me and CaRuby-Nano is shown in <a class="xref-fig" href="#fig6">Appendix figure 1B</a>. This analysis suggests that CaRuby-Nano would have a small advantage in signal size over CaRuby-Me for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients not exceeding 269 nM.</p><p>While this normalized signal size (i.e., fractional change in fluorescence) is the commonly reported value in quantitative microscopy, the signal-to-noise ratio of this signal determines how reliably it can be measured. To analyse the effect of indicator Ca<sup>2+</sup>-affinity on the SNR, we make a number of assumptions:</p><ol class="list-ord"><li><p>The resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is 50 nM.</p></li><li><p>The brightness of both indicators at maximal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is equal.</p></li><li><p>The detection system does not add additional noise sources.</p></li><li><p>The baseline fluorescence is calculated as the average of 50 time points.</p></li></ol><p>As fluorescence is a stochastic quantum event, the measured intensity (i.e., number of detected photons) will be determined by Poisson statistics (<a class="xref-bibr" href="#bib33">Pawley, 2006</a>). In consequence, the noise level of fluorescence is equal to the square root of the fluorescence intensity. To estimate how this noise determines the uncertainty of the calculated dF/F<sub>0</sub> values and ultimately which SNR can be achieved at a given maximum brightness, we performed a Monte-Carlo analysis: Random Poisson noise was added to the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-dependent fluorescence curves shown in <a class="xref-fig" href="#fig6">Appendix figure 1A</a>, this was repeated 10,000 times. In addition a signal baseline consisting of 50 points was generated by drawing samples from a Poisson distribution with a mean of the fluorescence expected at resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. For each iteration the dF/F<sub>0</sub> ratio was calculated. Finally the average dF/F<sub>0</sub> curve as well as the corresponding standard deviation (SD) over all iterations were determined. As the brightness of the sample (i.e., fluorescence intensity at maximal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]) strongly influences the SNR, this analysis was initially performed at a fixed maximum brightness of 1000 photons (e.g., the signal resulting from four detected fluorescence photons per excitation pulse at a 3 µs pixel dwell time). While the resulting noise appears negligible against the raw Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding curve in <a class="xref-fig" href="#fig6">Appendix figure 1A</a>, the propagated error following dF/F<sub>0</sub> normalization is substantial (<a class="xref-fig" href="#fig6">Appendix figure 1B</a>) and the resulting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-dependent SNR (SNR<sub>([Ca2+])</sub> = Fluorescence<sub>([Ca2+])</sub>/SD<sub>([Ca2+])</sub>) curves clearly show that as a consequence of the brighter baseline fluorescence the higher affinity CaRuby-Nano is expected to always yield a better SNR than CaRuby-Me under the simulated conditions. Under sufficiently bright conditions, such as those assumed in <a class="xref-fig" href="#fig6">Appendix figure 1A–C</a>, the much larger signal achievable at [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] over ∼400 nM outweighs this SNR advantage.</p><p>To see how the balance between SNR and signal amplitude change with changing signal brightness, we determined the SNR curves for varying levels of maximum brightness (from 10 to 10,000 photons; <a class="xref-fig" href="#fig6">Appendix figure 1D,E</a>). As expected we find that for a given indicator, the dimmer the imaging conditions, the larger a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient needs to be for reliable detection (assumed to require SNR ≥ 2). On the other hand, the required [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient amplitude for reliable detection at a given brightness strongly depends on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of the indicator, with higher affinity CaRuby-Nano requiring substantially smaller transients than CaRuby-Me (<a class="xref-fig" href="#fig6">Appendix figure 1F</a>). What is a level of brightness that can be expected in biological imaging? Tan et al. reported a photon-flux range of 1–4 photons per µs at rest when using Oregon–Green 488 BAPTA-1 (<a class="xref-bibr" href="#bib34">Tan et al., 1999</a>) (OGB-1), which would correspond to approximately 3–12 photons at fully saturating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Thus, even when summing the signal from dozens of pixels, maximum brightness is expected to be in the range of 100–500 photons for standard pixel dwell times (1–4 µs). At this brightness CaRuby-Me would require Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients reaching ∼290 nM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] to cross the SNR = 2 threshold (just below the level of the transients evoked by a single action potential in CA1 pyramidal neurons [<a class="xref-bibr" href="#bib32">Maravall et al., 2000</a>]) whereas CaRuby-Nano would require transients under 100 nM.</p><p>Taken together these results show that while under bright conditions low-affinity indicators have the advantage of larger signal amplitudes, under the dimmer conditions often found in biological imaging, lower affinity dyes will often be working at the edge of the detectability. Thus, for quantification of small, localized (i.e., where it is not possible to average many pixels) Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, high affinity indicators such as OGB-1 and CaRuby-Nano are needed.</p></div></div>
