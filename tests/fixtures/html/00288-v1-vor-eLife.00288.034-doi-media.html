The upper right panel represents spatial spread of cell-free virus during the episode. The lower left panel represents CD8+ T-cell density within each region. The lower right panel indicates reproductive number within each region. Quantities are displayed according to a heat map adjacent to each spatial map. The simulated episode is prolonged because virus spreads from the initial region to adjacent regions with low CD8+ T-cell density and reproductive numbers less than one, and is not contained until many regions of the genital tract are infected.</p><p><strong>DOI:</strong> <a href="/lookup/doi/10.7554/eLife.00288.034">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00288.034</a></p>
